description: "Sebastian introduces the new co-host of the podcast, in a special episode recorded on location at droidcon New York! Joined by Russell Wolf, author of the multiplatform-settings library, we discuss the conference, different code sharing approaches for Kotlin Multiplatform, and how to build great multiplatform libraries."
bio: "Russell started his first Kotlin Multiplatform project the day after it was possible to share code between JVM and Kotlin/Native. He is the author and maintainer of Multiplatform Settings, a key-value storage library which was one of the earliest mobile multiplatform libraries available. He loves finding new ways to connect with this community and help people and organizations use this technology."
